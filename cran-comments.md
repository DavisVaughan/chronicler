## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs with R CMD check. 

There was 2 NOTEs on Rhub:

*  checking CRAN incoming feasibility
   Maintainer: 'Bruno Rodrigues <bruno@brodrigues.co>'
   
   New submission
   
* checking for detritus in the temp directory
   Found the following files/directories:
     'lastMiKTeXException'

I believe both these notes are inconsequential for the package's release.
